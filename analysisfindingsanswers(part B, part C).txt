CRYPTO TRADER BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS — FINDINGS & EVIDENCE
================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------
PART B — ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION 1: Does performance differ between Fear vs Greed days?
----------------------------------------------------------------
YES — performance differs meaningfully between Fear and Greed days.

Fear days showed lower daily PnL and lower win rates compared to
Greed days. The Mann-Whitney statistical test confirmed this
difference is real and not random (p-value recorded in
sentiment_metric_tests.csv).

Key findings:
- Daily PnL is lower on Fear days across most accounts
- Win rate drops on Fear days — traders close fewer profitable trades
- Drawdown proxy (daily_min_cum_pnl) is more negative on Fear days,
  meaning traders experience deeper intra-day losses during Fear

- See: boxplot_win_rate_by_sentiment.png
- See: sentiment_metric_tests.csv


QUESTION 2: Do traders change behavior based on sentiment?
----------------------------------------------------------------
YES — traders clearly change their behavior based on sentiment.

Trade Frequency:
- Traders place more trades on Greed days than Fear days
- On Fear days, trading activity reduces — suggesting caution

Leverage:
- Average leverage is higher on Greed days
- On Fear days traders slightly reduce leverage (but not enough
  in the high-leverage cluster — this is what Rule 1 addresses)

Long/Short Bias:
- Traders go more LONG on Greed days
- Traders go more SHORT or reduce long exposure on Fear days
- This is consistent with market sentiment behavior

Position Sizes:
- Position sizes are larger on Greed days
- Traders are more conservative with sizing on Fear days

Evidence:
- See: agg_behav_by_sentiment.csv
- See: pct_long_by_sentiment.csv
- See: ts_total_pnl_sentiment.png


QUESTION 3: Trader Segments (Clusters)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Three distinct trader segments were identified using K-Means
clustering (k=3) based on leverage, win rate, and trade frequency.

CLUSTER 0 — Consistent Winners
- Average win rate: 0.58 (highest of all clusters)
- Moderate leverage: ~24,145
- Moderate trade frequency: ~1,533 trades/day
- These traders are disciplined and consistently profitable
- They perform best on Greed days

CLUSTER 1 — High Leverage / Frequent Traders
- Average leverage: ~28,664 (highest of all clusters)
- Highest trade frequency: ~11,995 trades/day
- Win rate: 0.59 but high risk due to extreme leverage
- These traders are most exposed on Fear days
- Capping their leverage on Fear days reduces platform volatility

CLUSTER 2 — Inconsistent / Struggling Traders
- Average win rate: 0.28 (lowest of all clusters)
- Negative average leverage (-445,764) suggests data anomalies
  or short-heavy positions
- Low profitability overall
- These traders perform poorly regardless of sentiment

Evidence:
- See: cluster_scatter.png
- See: account_segments.csv
- See: cluster_summary.csv


QUESTION 4: At Least 3 Insights
----------------------------------------------------------------
INSIGHT 1 — Fear days hurt performance across all traders
PnL and win rate are consistently lower on Fear days. The platform
total PnL dropped significantly on Fear days as shown in the
timeseries chart. Traders should reduce risk exposure on Fear days.
See: ts_total_pnl_sentiment.png

INSIGHT 2 — High leverage traders cause most platform volatility
Cluster 1 (high leverage, ~28k avg leverage) drives the majority
of platform-level PnL swings. Original daily volatility was
2,581,231. After capping their leverage on Fear days, volatility
dropped to 2,311,222 — a reduction of ~270,000. Controlling this
segment significantly stabilizes the platform.
See: strategy_simulation_daily_impact_partc_final.csv

INSIGHT 3 — Consistent winners (Cluster 0) are reliable on Greed days
Cluster 0 traders have a 0.58 win rate and perform best during
Greed days. Increasing their position size by 20% on Greed days
generated positive delta for top accounts (e.g. +7,505 and +10,443
for two accounts). These traders are the safest to give more
exposure to.

----------------------------------------------------------------
PART C — ACTIONABLE OUTPUT (STRATEGY RULES)
----------------------------------------------------------------

RULE 1: During Fear days, cap leverage at 3x for high-leverage
traders (Cluster 1)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Rationale:
Cluster 1 traders use extremely high leverage (~28,664 average).
On Fear days, this leads to large drawdowns and increased platform
volatility. By capping leverage at 3x during Fear days:
- Platform daily volatility reduced from 2,581,231 to 2,311,222
- Worst affected account PnL loss was contained
- Overall platform risk reduced significantly

Rule: IF sentiment == Fear AND trader in Cluster 1
      THEN cap leverage at 3x maximum


RULE 2: During Greed days, increase position size by 20% for
consistent winners (Cluster 0) with win rate > 0.5
----------------------------------------------------------------
Rationale:
Cluster 0 traders are consistent winners with 0.58 average win
rate. On Greed days, market conditions favor their strategy.
Giving them 20% more size on Greed days:
- Generated positive delta for top performing accounts
- Rewarded disciplined traders with more capital exposure
- Did not increase platform risk (these traders are profitable)

Rule: IF sentiment == Greed AND trader in Cluster 0
      AND historical win rate > 0.5
      THEN increase position size by 20%


PREDICTIVE MODEL SUMMARY
----------------------------------------------------------------
A Random Forest classifier was trained to predict whether a
trader will be profitable the next day.

- Accuracy : 0.76
- F1 Score : 0.81
- AUC      : 0.83
- CV AUC   : 0.72 +/- 0.11

Top predictive features (in order of importance):
1. rol_leverage_7  (0.39) — 7-day rolling leverage
2. rol_trades_7    (0.22) — 7-day rolling trade frequency
3. rol_size_7      (0.18) — 7-day rolling position size
4. sentiment_num   (0.11) — market sentiment (Fear/Greed)
5. rol_winrate_7   (0.10) — 7-day rolling win rate

Key finding: Leverage is the strongest predictor of next-day
profitability — confirming that managing leverage (Rule 1) is
the most impactful strategy intervention.
